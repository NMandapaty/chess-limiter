* Tasks
** TODO Investigate adding right click menu
*** Toggle blocking
*** Toggle dev mode?
** TODO Update popup UI to reflect time spent playing
** TODO Allow users to edit limits during session, but only "down"
*** Allow going back up but only to initial limit at session start

* Notes
** Technical Stack
- Framework: WXT (Web Extension Framework)
- TypeScript
- Browser Extension APIs (declarativeNetRequest, storage, runtime)

** Architecture
*** Background Script
- Monitors chess game limits
- Updates blocking rules dynamically
- Tracks game results (win/loss/draw)
- Auto-resets stats after 12 hours

*** Blocking Mechanism
- Uses declarativeNetRequest API
- Redirects to blocked.html when limits exceeded
- Blocks URLs:
  - Chess.com: =*://www.chess.com/service/matcher/seeks/chess=
  - Lichess: =*://lichess.org/play/*=

* Ideas & Future Work
** Add analytics/statistics dashboard
** Support for additional chess platforms
